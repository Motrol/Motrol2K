Motion Control Gaming for NBA2K17</br>

#Introduction
This project is based on Unity Engine and developed with C# on VisualStudio Platform.</br>

#Build
To launch the project, Unity Engine is required and versions later than 5.3.0 are preferred. This repository can be opened directly with Unity Engine, and however， project file for VisualStudio is also available and you can launch the project with VisualStudio as well.</br>
If you don't want to build the project, which is indeed annoying since everyone has not got a Unity Engine, you can simply run the exe file and I am sure that it will work in most cases.</br>
#About the project
In this prototype, we demonstrated how the captured skeleton motions can be replayed and distinguished. With the specific partition of the static motions and recognition via time window, the motions are translated into simple manipulation in the Game NBA2K17.</br>

#P.S.
  Since we have been using some special equipments capturing the motions, online demonstration has not been deployed in this repository, however, the recorded data is of the equivalent value. 
And as for the game, the key map has been changed, where </br>
'SPACE' denotes shoot(include fake), </br>
'K' denotes pass,</br>
'B' denotes block and </br>
‘Q’ denotes fancy skills. </br>
This project is far from polish and yet I am making an effort to reach accomplishment.
